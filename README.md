# DuolingoLearnedWords

This code writes your learned words from Duolingo to a markdown file (.md).

### Usage

You can choose to write your information/preferences in the config.txt file or enter them during execution.
The program will then create a .md file with the learned words and their translation in the specified directory. 

### Config

- When entering the file path, make sure to use \\ instead of \ when seperating (Ex: D:\\Code\\DuolingoLearnedWords\\)
- Make sure to fill both username and password, if entering any (Otherwise the program will prompt you to enter the details)
- Make sure to fill both filePath and fileName, if entering any (Otherwise the program will prompt you to enter the details)

**NOTE**: The username and password stored in the config.txt file is **NOT ENCRYPTED**, be careful when saving information into the file.
            You can instead enter your information when the program prompts you, as it does not save the input data in any file(s)
